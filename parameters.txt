# nturns: Number of turns taken in measurement. Passed to harmonic analysis.
# ringID: Name of the ring used for TbT acquisition, "HER" or "LER".
# lattice: Path of the SAD lattice you will be using.
# input_data_path: Path to directory containing KEK TbT data files.
# kickax: Used in asynch analysis to determine which axis to analyse.
#		  Generally, the axis in which kicks are applied has cleaner
#		  data which is more suitable for analysis.
# BetaBeatsrc_path: Path to the Beta-Beat.src package.
# BetaBeatsrc_path: Path to the OMC3 package.
# model_path: Directory into which the model information for
#	     	  Beta-Beat.src scripts is stored (and where additional
#			  information will be created).
# main_output_path: Directory into which all output (not sdds files)
#	      			will be placed.
# unsynched_sdds_path: Where sdds files in the first stage (without
#	    			   asynch fix) will be stored.
# synched_sdds_path: Where sdds files in the second stage (with asynch
#					 fix) will be stored.
# file_dict: File which contains translations from KEK datafiles to
#	     	 desired sdds names.
# gsad: Path to the SAD executable.
# python_exe: Path to the python executable.
# python3_exe: Path to the python3 executable.
